<h2 style="color: yellow;">Purpose</h2>

Sick of the awkward **Win+B** and **Enter** dance to access your system tray?! Not first, that's for sure! I scoured online all over the internet for a more sophisticated approach, but I was unable to find anything for as simple as this, got inspired to make Tray Launcher and it fixes that specifically. With a simple single click from a convenient desktop shortcut, you can quickly access your tray icons anytime you need them and manage apps. Additionally, it **automatically puts the tray back** after you're finished, maintaining a tidy and orderly workspace. This implies that you may now focus on being productive and have a smoother workflow!

<h2 style="color: yellow;">Overview</h2>


**Tray** launcher is a lightweight Windows application [only 1,180 kb] and [working set 1.5-.6 mb] designed to enhance your productivity by efficiently managing the system tray. Originally developed as an AutoHotkey (AHK) script, this tool launches the system tray on demand and smartly collapses it when not needed, keeping your workspace organized and clutter-free.

<strong><h2 style="color: yellow;">Features</h2></strong>


- <strong><p style="color: yellow;">On-Demand Launch</p></strong>Quickly access the system tray whenever you need it on a click rather than key combination Win + B and Return.

- <strong><p style="color: yellow;">Smart Auto-Collapse</p></strong>Automatically collapses the system tray and exit app when it's not in use and loose focus, helping maintain a clean desktop environment.

- <strong><p style="color: yellow;">Lightweight</p></strong>Minimal impact on system resources, running seamlessly standalone on demand with just 1.5mb working set.

   <strong><p style="color: #26ff00;">!!! ** It DOES NOT Run in the BACKGROUND ** !!!</p></strong>
